# Tenderpack landing review — 2026-02-21 13:07

## Visual observations (desktop + mobile)

- Production root `/` is returning a Next.js `404: NOT_FOUND` screen (both desktop and mobile).
- Above-the-fold is entirely blank aside from the error card — zero value proposition/CTA visible.
- No navigation/footer present; this looks like an app error page rather than a marketing page.
- Trust is immediately lost: an error state as the first impression is catastrophic for conversion.
- No readable hierarchy/spacing/typography to assess because the page content doesn’t render.
- The error page includes an internal-ish “ID” string; this may not be desirable to expose to end users.
